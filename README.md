# my karabiner config
- map caps_lock to right cmd+ctrl+shift+alt
- button4/5 to forword/backword
- map button4/5 to middle button in AutoCAD2018/SketchUp2017
- most important, swap alt/cmd in macvim/iterm2/terminal, but keep origin when work with tab/space/any_other_modifiers
- cmd+enter for fullscreen in mostly apps
